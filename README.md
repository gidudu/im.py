im.py is a p2p communications tool written in Python 2.7.1.  It allows two users on two different computers to chat with each other.

Following is a simple FAQ:
What does this do that IRC can't?  What does this do that AIM can't? 
--It allows direct communication between two computers, whereas IRC 
doesn't.  And AIM and similar services require a username, etc.  This 
is made specifically for two users on a network to chat. 
What is the licence? 
--See "LICENCE".

To install, type "make all", then "make install".
Enjoy!
